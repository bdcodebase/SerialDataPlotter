# SerialDataPlotter
Plots data incoming via COM or Bloototh Low Energy (Nordic BLEUART).
Tested only with Windows 11 and a very limited number of devices.

## HowTo:
Run "SerialDataPlotter.py", grab the config from "config" tab and adjust it to your needs. Start with that config file as "--config" parameter.
UI is still pretty basic. To use BLEUART, put "Address *device address*" in `com` parameter of the config, or in edit field next to connect button.
